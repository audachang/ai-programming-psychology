# Programming and AI Application in Psychology

## Course Overview: Hybrid AI-Assisted Learning

This course adopts a **Hybrid AI-Assisted Learning** model, integrating cutting-edge AI tools into the psychological research workflow. Students will learn not just to code, but to **collaborate with AI** (Claude, ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot) to design experiments, analyze neural data, and build computational models.

**Core Philosophy:**
- **Code with AI:** From "writing code" to "reviewing and architecting code" generated by AI.
- **Think like a Data Scientist:** Using Python for reproducible open science.
- **Build like an Engineer:** Version control, testing, and documentation.
